This is a coding test for [*Truextend*](https://www.truextend.com)

**Technologies in the Backend**
The backend was developed in Node.js with Express Framework and it has installed the most important modules:

 - **Express**.- Framework for Node.js
 - **Mongodb**.- Driver for database connection
 - **Babel**.- It is a toolchain that is commonly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.


**Database**
The persistent storage is the NoSQL Database MongoDB.

 **Technologies in the Frontend**
 The Frontend was developed in the Javascript framework Angular 8, some tools are needed for a better User Experience:
 
 - **SweetAlert**.- It help us to show alerts, confirmations and errors messages to the user.
 - **Bootstrap**.- It allow us to build very nice and  intuitive interfaces with some components like Buttons, Menus, Colors, etc.

**Recommendations**

 - A security system should be implemented, based in Guards of Angular and a login page for the user authentication.
 - The menus has to get from the database, for rol and permitions management.
 - The Backend has to manage a Token system and encrypted passwords with middleswares in the routes.  

**Instructions**

 - After clone or download the source code, you must run "npm install" command to download all modules that are necessaries for the Backend and Frontend run.
 - For the Backend you have to run "npm run dev" command to run the application in dev mode.
 - For the Frontend you need to run "npm start" command to run the application in dev mode.
